Today we talk to\u00a0real estate agent, entrepreneur, author, and\u00a0Million Dollar Listing New York\u00a0star,\u00a0Ryan Serhant.\u00a0You\u2019ve probably seen Ryan selling ridiculously nice (and expensive) homes on TV, but today you\u2019ll be the private audience to hear his backstory, his work ethic, and\u00a0how he developed his big confidence.Ryan moved to New York to\u00a0become the next big star in theatre, but after seeing the financial position of those \u201csuccessful\u201d actors he looked up to, he made a pivot. Ryan got his\u00a0real estate license\u00a0and\u00a0started listing apartments to pay his bills, but was given a golden opportunity when an\u00a0foreign buyer specifically chose him to find her next multi-million dollar home\u00a0in New York City. Ryan still remembers the lack of confidence he felt when he got the listing, and knew the only thing to do was educate himself and practice his pitch.

He invested in a multifamily deal in Atlanta, overleveraged himself, and had it foreclosed on him. A few years later, he had another Atlanta property taken from home. Welby was wiped out. He got scammed, lied to, and dove in too deep a couple times.After these tough experiences, he knew he had to do whatever he could to make sure his due diligence was top notch. He was later told about Connecticut, and decided to take some serious time exploring the market, building relationships, and networking.

This is exactly what Ayoka Moss and Robert Charles thought, until they were put in a situation where entrepreneurialism and real estate was the only option.Ayoka had serious drive, especially after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad (a favorite of the BP community). Robert, on the other hand, was working as hard as he could, selling cars, breaking sales records, but once he was let go due to his company being bought out, he had open ears for Ayoka\u2019s proposal. Ayoka and Robert decided to start wholesaling real estate, and had 6 failed deals before they finally found themselves making a profit.

What happens when you\u2019re hit with a $16,000 bill to fix a sewer, or when 20 of your tenants call you all at once with problems? Some things, like those examples, make active real estate investors envy passive investors. This is why Tamar Hermes decided to go on a more passive route for real estate investing.\u00a0Tamar started at age 28, working as an executive in the television industry. She realized that she was trading her time for money, and without her job, she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her bills. So, she put 10% down on a duplex and started house hacking. Over time she bought more and more duplexes, some even out of her 401(k). She was an aspiring landlord, but after being hit with the situations above, she decided to sell all her units in Los Angeles and put her money into more passive income streams.Now she\u2019s invested in syndications, like Brandon\u2019s Open Door Capital to be exact. This gives her far more freedom to pursue her passions in life, without having to worry about those 2 A.M. toilet calls. Tamar refers to herself as a very cautious investor, and that may be why she feels far more diversified with passive investing than active investing.She also talks through \u201cfinding your tribe\u201d and how Gobundance has helped her meet friends and partners within the real estate space. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to go out and find a group, but having friends and allies within your certain niche can help move you miles ahead of the competition!In This Episode We Cover:Using house hacking as a way to fuel your real estate investing\u00a0The difference between passive and active real estate investingFinding cash flow AND appreciation when looking for rental properties\u201cUpgrading your investing\u201d and growing your investor mindsetRecourse vs non-recourse loansFinding quality agents, certified financial planners, and other partnersAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowBiggerPockets ForumsOpen Door CapitalTravel Nurse HousingGrant CardoneGoBundanceBiggerPockets BookstoreBiggerPockets Podcast 423: Who Not How: Stop Doing the Things You Hate, Free Up Time, Be Happier and Richer with Dan SullivanJosh Dorkin\u00a0Check the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/show458       ", "duration_ms": 4003135, "genres": ["Business & Technology"], "publisher": "BiggerPockets", "release_date": "2021-04-08", "show_rank": "7", "show_num_reviews": 14652}, {"id": "7AjA9W1rnSkMyp1rjnjGfR", "show_id": "23JyccHPmQ8fzmpmnvQ6hR", "name": "457: How Thinking 5 Moves Ahead Can Make You Millions with Patrick Bet-David", "description": "         Some people are born into wealth, but none are born into success. Success needs to be earned, through pain, hard work, and perseverance.Patrick Bet-David\u00a0came to the United States during the Iranian Revolution of 1978, after already being a refugee in Germany. Patrick\u00a0served in the U.S. Army\u00a0and prided himself on his ability to party, but after a family health emergency, he decided enough was enough, and he became the\u00a0hard-working, driven man he is today.Now, a\u00a0successful businessman, media producer, best selling author, and CEO, Patrick has a lot of wisdom to share for young and aspiring businesspeople. One of his biggest lessons:\u00a0don\u2019t waste your pain. Patrick shows how the best of the best in business, sports, or any other field are consistently\u00a0putting themselves in positions where they have to fight to be the best. Patrick argues that even if you\u2019re the best basketball player in your high school, once you go to college you may be at the bottom of the list, and once you become the best in college, you may be stuck again at the bottom of the professional leagues. This means\u00a0you have to constantly change, adapt, and\u00a0improve yourself\u00a0to become the best of the best.We also talk about Patrick\u2019s book,\u00a0Your Next Five Moves\u00a0and how people who are masters in their skillset are\u00a0thinking at least five moves ahead of their competition. Want to buy a house? What are the next 5-10 moves you could make right now to get that done. Most people do a single step, stop because it\u2019s too hard, and leave it at that.

How do you even get to 100 units when it\u2019s already challenging enough to get one? That answer is simple: stack them slowly over time. That\u2019s exactly what today\u2019s guest, Erika Sleger, did. Erika heard about house hacking from a lecture in college, so once she graduated she decided to buy a fourplex, live in one unit, and rent out the others.She learnt some valuable skills from that first fourplex and later sold it for a nice profit, 1031 exchanged it into an 18 unit, and started collecting rent. From there, she used her equity on the 18 unit to buy a 64 unit. Another 16 units here, some more units there, and before she knew it Erika had over 120 rental units. She acquired all of these properties through 1031 exchanges and pulling cash out via refinances for down payments.Managing over 100 units isn\u2019t easy, it took Erika a while to find management that worked, and she was still managing her managers. Even with the best due diligence, Erika talks through the challenges of filling and managing so many units. That\u2019s why Erika sold her multifamily properties and moved her money into commercial real estate.Now she owns \u201camazon-proof\u201d commercial spaces for coffee shops, a daycare center, and even a car maintenance shop. These leases are triple net, and give her the flexibility to move wherever she wants in the world, without having to over-manage a property manager.

It\u2019s a memoir about being two kids in love, and then suddenly having a touring live show based on a weird fiction podcast and traveling around the world together.  You can pre-order it now! Just go to tinyurl.com/firsttenyears or wherever you get your books.  Here\u2019s the official synopsis if you want more info:   A sometimes hilarious, occasionally heartbreaking, and always entertaining joint memoir by Joseph Fink, cocreator of\u00a0Welcome to Night Vale, and his wife, writer and performer Meg Bashwiner, chronicling the first ten years of their relationship from both sides.  In 2009, 22-year-old Joseph Fink, newly arrived to New York City from the West Coast, was juggling odd jobs to pay the rent and volunteering with a theater company in the East Village so he could snag free tickets to their shows.  Meg Bashwiner, a 22-year-old aspiring performer and playwright, was living with her parents in New Jersey, working a desk job and commuting to her internship with that same East Village theater company.  Joseph and Meg's stories meet when they both find themselves selling tickets in a cramped box office. They quickly became friends. Within a year, they were a couple. Within five years they were touring the world, performing on some of the world's greatest and not so great stages.  In this candid, soul-baring memoir, Joseph and Meg recount their first ten years together, each telling their story as they remember it, without having consulted the other. We hear both sides of their first kiss, first breakup, first getting back together, the death of a father, marriage, international fame, world tours, mental illness, and discussions about having children. Sometimes, they recall things differently\u2014neither agrees on who paid for the morning after pill on their first date. Sometimes they remember the exact same details in the same way\u2014but still have their own narrative on just what those details mean.  Poignant, funny, and real, alternately told in Joseph and Meg\u2019s remarkably different, yet equally compelling voices,\u00a0The First Ten Years\u00a0is the story of two individuals finding their way in the world and becoming \"adults\" as they learn to become a couple.

Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.  Today, Will Smith sits down with Jay Shetty to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father\u2019s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.  Jay Shetty\u2019s Conversation With Will Smith: Today, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Jay asks Will: \u201cTell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It\u2019s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts.\u00a0 Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It\u2019s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn\u2019t feel like true happiness. Jay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete\u2019s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life.\u00a0 Jay mentions how Will\u2019s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived.\u00a0 Jay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don\u2019t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within. Jay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience. Jay taps into Will\u2019s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d, who knows it could be the last. Jay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions. Jay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you. Jay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant.\u00a0 Jay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice. Will explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal.\u00a0 Will discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding. Will retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles.\u00a0 Jay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.\u00a0\u00a0 Jay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn\u2019t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness. Jay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of. Will relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.\u00a0 Will Smith ON the Fast Five questions  Like this show?

I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks.

I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more. Note: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said \u201cP-M-O-C\u201d but should have said \u201cPOMC\u201d. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: \"proopiomelanocortin\".

I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impacts testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed. **Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in fertility, athletic performance and recovery. \u00a0 Thank you to our sponsors:  Four Sigmatic - http://foursigmatic.com/huberman Blinkist - http://blinkist.com/huberman Theragun - http://theragun.com/huberman  \u00a0 Bloodwork sponsor:  InsideTracker - http://insidetracker.com/huberman  \u00a0 Our Patreon page:  https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman  \u00a0 Supplements from Thorne:  http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman  \u00a0 Social:  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab Twitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab  \u00a0 References:  http://examine.com \u201cBehavioral Endocrinology\u201d by Nelson and Kriegsfeld 5th Ed.

It's recommended to play the sound at least a few feet from where your infant is sleeping and to keep the volume no louder than the sound of a soft shower. Parents can download an app to turn their smartphone into a sound level meter. One good, free, option is the sound level meter app created by the U.S. National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) available on the app store as the NIOSH SLM app. Soothe your crying baby and enjoy a moment of calm!
